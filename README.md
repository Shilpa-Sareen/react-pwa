# react-pwa
This is a demo for react app which will respond when offline. 
There are two apis used in this example: 
The first api is :  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users and when clicking on Refresh button it will hit: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments 
Both will be cached by the Service-worker.js
